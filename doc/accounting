Accounting System

This is a double-entry accounting system. This system is included in the reservation system so that it easily integrates with contract payments. However, it may make more sense to separate it into its own process, both for security and maintenance reasons.

TABLES

Postings
A credit or debit into or out of an account. Whether it's a credit or debit depends upon the account.
