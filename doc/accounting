Accounting System

This is a double-entry accounting system. This system ultimately will be included in the resource scheduling system so that it easily tracks contract invoices and payments. It is being made into a gem first so that others may use it in their applications.


DEBIT/CREDIT EQUATION

Normal Debit Balance Accounts = Normal Credit Balance Accounts
Assets + Draws + Expenses = Liabilities + Beginning Capital + Revenue
This looks totally bizarre unless you look at the equation as a historical record of the business. The current assets plus what was taken out of those assets (draws and expenses) equals what was owed to other people (liabilities) plus what was originally contributed (beginning capital) plus any income that came in (revenue).

This equation can be rewritten:
0 = Liabilities + Beginning Capital + Revenue - (Assets + Draws + Expenses)
0 = Liabilities + Beginning Capital + Revenue - Assets - Draws - Expenses

So if we store the amounts correctly in the database, we can easily check the integrity of the database by summing all amounts and testing for zero.

To "store the amounts correctly in the database," we make sure that the amounts for all postings belonging to a journal sum to zero before committing those postings to the database. It seems to follow that:

First Account     Second Account
===============   ===============
debit account     debit account
(+)               (-)

credit account    credit account
(+)               (-)

debit account     credit account
(+)               (+)

credit account    debit account
(+)               (+)



TABLES

Accounts
An Account has_many Accounts as subaccounts. An Account has_many Journals.

Postings
Postings belong_to an Account and belong_to a Journal. A Posting represents either a credit or a debit for an account.

Journals
A Journal has_many Postings. All postings associated with a journal must sum to zero.

Batches
A Batch has_many Journals. A Batch controls the immutability of Postings associated with Journals. A Batch record can be open or closed. When a Journal is created, it will associate itself (belong_to) the first open Batch it can find. If no Batches are open, a new Batch is created, opened and the Journal now belongs to that Batch.

Reconciles
A Reconcile record belongs to an Account and to a Posting. Initially, Reconcile records belong only to an Account but then belong to a Posting when that Reconcile is associated to a Posting. The relation between Reconcile and Posting is a HABTM so that a Reconcile can have many Postings and a Posting can have many Reconciles. This allows a Reconcile record to be made up of many Postings and vice-versa.

FEATURES AND CAPABILITIES

Journals should balance (the sum of associated Postings should equal zero) before saving. Postings may only be updated if the Journal they belong to has an associated Batch.

Postings should indicate one of three states: uncleared, cleared and reconciled.

Reconciling an account involves the association of Reconciles with Postings and vice-versa. Ideally, the system may auto-associate Reconciles with Postings based on amounts and transaction dates.


INTERFACE TO APPLICATIONS

The accounting system may receive input from an application. That input should be traceable back to a specific model record in the application. Therefore, a polymorphic association column should be added to both Postings and Accounts. That way, a Posting may be traced back to one record in the application (for example, a contract, a contract_line_item, a timecard or a transaction) and an Account may be traced back to another record in a different model (for example, a user, an entity, a piece of equipment).

The application may require information from the accounting system (for example, the balance on an account, the individual payments for a contract).
